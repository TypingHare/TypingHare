# 👋 Hi, I am James Chen

I am a computer science graduate student and aspiring software engineer who explores core CS concepts through hands-on projects.

I have been writing code since 2018 and have embraced vibe coding since 2024. I not only have **strong coding fundamentals** but am also skilled at **guiding AI agents** with precise prompts to improve efficiency.

## Projects

These projects gave me a lot of solid, hands-on development experience, and they’re some of the most polished and complete ones I’ve worked on. I’ve put my other half-finished or outdated little side projects over [here](https://github.com/TypingHare/archives).
